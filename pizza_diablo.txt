Method:

Prepare your pizza dough ahead of time. Our guide to making the perfect Classic Pizza Dough covers everything you need to know. 

For the sauce for this pizza, we recommend preparing our easy Classic Pizza Sauce. With a hint of garlic, salt and basil, it's the ideal pizza sauce that will help to bring out the flavours in the other ingredients used here.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the mince with chilli powder, chilli flakes, dried basil, garlic powder, salt and tomato puree. With your fingers, squeeze the mix together until fully incorporated. Then, use your palms to form into 8-10 small meatballs. 

Fire up your Ooni pizza oven. Aim for 250˚C (482˚F) on the stone baking board inside. You can check the temperature inside your Ooni quickly and easily using the Ooni Infrared Thermometer.

Lightly oil your Cast Iron Pan, and place it inside the oven to preheat. After a couple of minutes, remove the pan from the oven and add your meatballs. Place the pan back in the oven and cook the meatballs for 5-7 minutes. Once the meatballs begin to brown, remove the pan and give it a quick toss to turn the meatballs. Cook for a further 5-7 minutes until the meatballs are cooked through. Set aside to cool.

Allow the oven to come to 500˚C (950˚F).

Using a small amount of flour, dust your Ooni pizza peel. Stretch the pizza dough ball out and lay it out on your peel. Using a large spoon or ladle, spread the sauce evenly across the pizza base. Top with your cheese, then add your parma ham, pepperoni, and meatballs. Finish with a garnish of finely sliced chili peppers and if you dare, a drizzle of your favourite hot sauce.
